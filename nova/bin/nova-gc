# (amscanne): Normally, a nova service would import eventlet here and
# monkey_patch the core libraries so use the greenthread-friendly versions.
# However, we've encountered several strange problems that seem to stem from
# eventlet-style handling of events. In the manager workflow, the control flow
# seems to fall off a cliff at arbitrary points and never return. This is very
# bad, as it means that we get VMs that are stuck in the network allocation
# stage or the BUILD stage. We actually already have natural greenthread
# friendly cut points in our code (vmsconn uses the eventlet tpool methods to
# execute the underlying vms routines) so code paths will not block for
# excessive amounts of time and the greenthreads will still work as expected.
# Thus, we do *NOT* monkey patch the core routines, and instead allow them to
# block as normal.

# so that we may pull out the connection string paramters.
